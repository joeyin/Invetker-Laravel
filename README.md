The database schema for INVETKER is designed to effectively manage user data and stock transactions.

The Users table holds essential information, including usernames, unique emails, and securely hashed passwords.

The Transactions table links to the Users table with a foreign key (userId), allowing each user to create and manage multiple portfolios. This table includes details such as ticker symbols, purchase prices, quantities, fees, actions, and purchase dates.

The About table records the product description that will be displayed on the front page.

## Reflection
Laravel is a really powerful PHP framework that offers everything you need, with clear and easily accessible documentation. The most important thing is that it reduces the gap in writing SQL, which I really love, especially for preventing SQL injection. The folder structure is also well-designed, although it can feel inconvenient at times during development. However, once you get used to it, you'll find it incredibly helpful and easy to manage your project.

## Notes
1. Integrating the Polygon API: This API provides stock information. Please note that the free plan allows only 5 requests per minute.
2. Admin Access: The "dashboard/about" page is accessible only to admins. The DatabaseSeeder will automatically add an admin account upon import, with the following credentials: (Email: service@good-series.com, Password: 12345678).
3. Responsive Web Design: All pages support responsive web design (RWD).
